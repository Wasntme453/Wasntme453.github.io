  <h1>Couch Potato</h1>
  <p>So you turn on the news and a commentator begins talking,"We're watching the insane events unnfold in times square as cars are being stopped in their tracks and covered in pancakes,Going live with reporter Megyn Cooper now."</p>
  <p>The screen switched to a blank screen. Audio played,"Sorry pancakes are getting on the screen, i'm wiping them off now-AAAGHH" There was nothing but a super loud pattering sound as the screen went blank.</p>
